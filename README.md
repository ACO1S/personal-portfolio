It serves as both a dynamic resume and an interactive showcase of my technical projects, giving visitors an opportunity to get to know me better and explore my work in more detail. The website is also designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing, reflecting both my design sense and technical capabilities.

## Technologies Used

This personal portfolio was built with the following technologies:

* **React** – The primary JavaScript library used to create the interactive elements of the site.
* **Vite** – A modern build tool for faster React development.

* **GitHub Pages** – For hosting and deploying the live version of the website.

### Features and Functionality

All ten projects are centrally managed and linked to Figma prototypes, Google Drive folders, and video presentations.
* **Immersive Visual Effects:** The site features **parallax scrolling** for depth, a **glowing cursor follower** for interactivity, and **glitch and typing animations** that make the hero name and role visually stand out.
* **Clear Structure and Accessibility:** Organized as a single-page layout with Home, About, Projects, and Contact sections, the portfolio offers easy navigation through a fixed header. The About section includes a clear education timeline, while social links and a downloadable résumé provide quick access to external profiles and resources.
